 * the router awaits before rendering, so a bad slug produces a server-rendered 404 rather than
 * one that flashes in after hydration.
 *
 * **Only a 404 means "no such store."** Any other failure — the API being unreachable, a 500, a
 * timeout — is transient and says nothing about whether the store exists. Redirecting on those
 * too would tell every shopper their store had vanished the moment the backend hiccuped, and
 * would make the whole storefront unreachable during a brief outage. Those cases activate the
