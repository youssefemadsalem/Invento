 *
 * The chain exists because this app is built once and deployed to environments
 * that inject config differently (SSR reads process.env; static hosts inject a
 * `window.__ENV__` blob at runtime).
 *
 * `googleClientId` was dropped from this class during the T174 move — auth (including Google
 * sign-in) migrated onto `@invento/shared-data-access-auth` at T163-T166, which reads
 * `AUTH_CONFIG.googleClientId` directly from the app's own environment; nothing here read it any
 * more.
