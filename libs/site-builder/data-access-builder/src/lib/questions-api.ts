/**
 * The onboarding questionnaire, served by `GET /site-builder/questions`.
 *
 * The backend owns this catalog: it validates submitted answers against the
 * same list and feeds them to the theme prompt, so a question the frontend
 * invented — or one the backend added and we never rendered — silently
 * degrades the generated store. INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS is kept only as an offline
 * fallback, not as the source of truth it used to be.
 *
 * Unlike the rest of the builder API this route carries no @Roles guard, so it
 * can be primed before the owner reaches the interview step.
