## The mental model in one paragraph

This is an **Nx monorepo of 119 projects**: 3 Angular applications and 116 libraries. The
applications are deliberately almost empty — they bootstrap, they wire configuration, and they map
URLs onto libraries. **All real code lives in `libs/`.** Every project declares two tags, one saying
_who it belongs to_ (`scope:`) and one saying _what kind of thing it is_ (`type:`). ESLint enforces
which tags may import which, so the architecture is not a convention you have to remember — it is a
lint error you cannot merge past.

---

## Applications are shells

| App                 | What it is              | Port   | Serve                           | Source                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **site-builder**    | Theme/brand generator   | `4200` | `npm start`                     | `apps/site-builder/src`    |
| **user-site**       | Multi-tenant storefront | `4300` | `npm run start:user-site`       | `apps/user-site/src`       |
| **owner-dashboard** | Admin dashboard         | `4400` | `npm run start:owner-dashboard` | `apps/owner-dashboard/src` |

All three run **at once** with `npm run start:all` — each `serve` target declares its own port and
`"continuous": true`, so they do not collide.

How thin "thin" actually is:

| App             | TS lines in `apps/*/src` | What lives in `src/app/`                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| site-builder    | 309                      | bootstrap only (`app.ts`, `app.config.ts`, `app.routes.ts`, …)            |
| user-site       | 424                      | bootstrap only                                                            |
| owner-dashboard | 447                      | bootstrap + 2 guards + 3 trivial pages (`no-store`, `not-found`, `users`) |

If you are about to add a component to `apps/`, stop. It almost certainly belongs in a library. An
app may hold: bootstrap files, its route table, its `AUTH_CONFIG` wiring, its `styles.css`, its
`assets/`, and the occasional page so trivial it has no logic worth a project. Nothing else.

### The three apps are not interchangeable

They share libraries, but they are shaped by different constraints, and the differences are
deliberate rather than drift:

|                   | site-builder       | user-site                        | owner-dashboard      |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Render mode**   | `Prerender`        | `Server`                         | `Client`             |
| **Audience**      | Prospective owners | Shoppers (public)                | Signed-in owners     |
| **Tenancy**       | Single             | **Multi-tenant** (`/:storeSlug`) | Single (per session) |
| **Auth role**     | `owner`            | `customer`                       | `owner`              |
| **Token key**     | `invento`          | `usersite`                       | `invento`            |
| **Own libraries** | 5                  | 13                               | 24                   |
| **Dev proxy**     | 4 prefixes         | none                             | 16 prefixes          |

Three consequences worth internalising:

- **All three build with `outputMode: server`, but only user-site actually server-renders.**
  owner-dashboard is `RenderMode.Client` — everything behind it is authenticated and none of it is
  SEO-relevant — so its build legitimately reports `Prerendered 0 static routes`. SSR hazards
  (hydration mismatch, `REQUEST`-token locale resolution) apply in practice to user-site.
- **site-builder and owner-dashboard share the `invento` token key on purpose**, so one owner
  session spans both. user-site uses `usersite` so a shopper session never collides with an
  owner one on the same host.
- **Only user-site is multi-tenant**, which is why its `AUTH_CONFIG` is built from closures over a
  runtime slug rather than declared as literals. Auth paths there are slug-scoped
  (`/{slug}/auth/login`); a hard-coded `/auth/...` link in that app is a bug.

Per-app detail — route trees, owned libraries, configuration seams and app-specific traps — lives
in [apps/](./apps/): [site-builder](./apps/site-builder.md), [user-site](./apps/user-site.md),
[owner-dashboard](./apps/owner-dashboard.md).

## The two axes

Every project carries **exactly one `scope:` tag and exactly one `type:` tag**. No exceptions — all
119 are verified to have both.

### `scope:` — who owns it

| Scope                   | Root                                                      | Meaning                                               | Projects |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `scope:shared`          | `libs/shared/*`, `libs/ui/*`, `libs/stepper`, `libs/core` | Usable by any app. May not depend on any app's scope. | 74       |
| `scope:owner-dashboard` | `libs/owner-dashboard/*` + `apps/owner-dashboard`         | Admin-dashboard domain                                | 25       |
| `scope:user-site`       | `libs/user-site/*` + `apps/user-site`                     | Storefront domain                                     | 14       |
| `scope:site-builder`    | `libs/site-builder/*` + `apps/site-builder`               | Builder domain                                        | 6        |

### `type:` — what kind of thing it is

| Type               | Contains                                                                                           | Public API (`src/index.ts`)                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `type:feature`     | Routed pages and smart components — the things a URL points at                                     | **A `Routes` array**, not components             |
| `type:data-access` | Services, stores, domain models. No templates, no styles.                                          | The service, the store, and `export type` models |
| `type:ui`          | Presentational components. Inputs and outputs only — no HTTP, no router, no injected data service. | The component                                    |
| `type:util`        | Pure functions, pipes, directives, constants, injection tokens                                     | The functions/pipes                              |
| `type:core`        | `libs/core` only — the preview engine, shared theme CSS, legacy interfaces                         | Mixed (legacy; nothing new should land here)     |
| `type:app`         | The three applications                                                                             | n/a                                              |

---

## The boundary matrices

Transcribed from `eslint.config.ts:34-72`. **Both matrices apply at once** — an import is legal only
if it satisfies the vertical rule _and_ the horizontal rule. There is no escape hatch: the rule's
`allow` list is deliberately empty.

### Vertical — which `type:` may depend on which

|                        | app | feature | data-access | ui  | util | core |
| ---------------------- | :-: | :-----: | :---------: | :-: | :--: | :--: |
| **`type:app`**         |  ✗  |   ✅    |     ✅      | ✅  |  ✅  |  ✅  |
| **`type:feature`**     |  ✗  |   ✅    |     ✅      | ✅  |  ✅  |  ✅  |
| **`type:data-access`** |  ✗  |    ✗    |     ✅      |  ✗  |  ✅  |  ✅  |
| **`type:ui`**          |  ✗  |    ✗    |      ✗      | ✅  |  ✅  |  ✗   |
| **`type:util`**        |  ✗  |    ✗    |      ✗      |  ✗  |  ✅  |  ✗   |
| **`type:core`**        |  ✗  |    ✗    |      ✗      |  ✗  |  ✅  |  ✅  |

Read it as a ladder: **app → feature → data-access → util**. Nothing may import an app. `ui` and
`util` are leaves — a `type:ui` component that needs to call an API is not a `type:ui` component.

> `type:app` may reach `type:data-access` directly. That is intentional, not a leak: guards,
> `AUTH_CONFIG`, and `authInterceptor` are wired at the composition root (`app.config.ts` /
> `app.routes.ts`), which is exactly where bootstrap wiring belongs.

### Horizontal — which `scope:` may depend on which

|                             | shared | owner-dashboard | user-site | site-builder |
| --------------------------- | :----: | :-------------: | :-------: | :----------: |
| **`scope:shared`**          |   ✅   |        ✗        |     ✗     |      ✗       |
| **`scope:owner-dashboard`** |   ✅   |       ✅        |     ✗     |      ✗       |
| **`scope:user-site`**       |   ✅   |        ✗        |    ✅     |      ✗       |
| **`scope:site-builder`**    |   ✅   |        ✗        |     ✗     |      ✅      |

Plainly: **each app's scope sees itself plus `shared`, and nothing else.** `shared` sees only
`shared`. user-site cannot import owner-dashboard code; shared cannot import any app's code.

### When you hit a boundary error

The error names both tags. Three legitimate fixes, in order of preference:

1. **Move the code to `shared`** — if two scopes genuinely need it.
2. **Change the `type:` tag** — if the tag is simply wrong. A "presentational" component that reads
   live session state is not `type:ui`; it is `type:feature`. `owner-dashboard-feature-shell` and
   `user-site-feature-storefront` (renamed from `ui-shell`/`ui-storefront`) are both tagged
   `type:feature` for exactly this reason — the honest fix was renaming the directory to match the
   tag, not adding an exemption.
3. **Invert the dependency** — pass the data in as an input instead of reaching for it.

Adding an entry to the `allow` list is **not** on that list. It has been empty since the restructure,
and every exemption that ever existed was fixed at the source instead of silenced.

---

## Naming: one scheme derives name and alias from path

This used to be the single most common time-waster in this workspace: 66 of 109 libraries had an Nx
project name that wasn't derivable from their directory path, because `scope:shared` libraries
dropped the scope prefix while the other three scopes kept it. That inconsistency is fixed — **every
`libs/shared/*` library was renamed to carry the `shared-` prefix** — so there is now exactly one
derivation rule, with three narrow, deliberate exceptions:

```
apps/<app>                    ->  <app>
libs/shared/<dir>             ->  shared-<dir>
libs/owner-dashboard/<dir>    ->  owner-dashboard-<dir>
libs/user-site/<dir>          ->  user-site-<dir>
libs/site-builder/<dir>       ->  site-builder-<dir>
libs/ui/<primitive>           ->  <primitive>       (bare — see below)
libs/core                     ->  core              (bare — see below)
libs/stepper                  ->  stepper           (bare — see below)
```

| Directory                               | Nx project name<br>(`nx lint` / `nx build`) | Import alias<br>(`import … from`)           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `libs/shared/ui-loader`                 | `shared-ui-loader`                          | `@invento/shared-ui-loader`                 |
| `libs/shared/data-access-auth`          | `shared-data-access-auth`                   | `@invento/shared-data-access-auth`          |
| `libs/shared/util-i18n`                 | `shared-util-i18n`                          | `@invento/shared-util-i18n`                 |
| `libs/owner-dashboard/feature-products` | `owner-dashboard-feature-products`          | `@invento/owner-dashboard-feature-products` |
| `libs/user-site/data-access-cart`       | `user-site-data-access-cart`                | `@invento/user-site-data-access-cart`       |
| `libs/site-builder/feature-home`        | `site-builder-feature-home`                 | `@invento/site-builder-feature-home`        |
| `libs/ui/button`                        | `button`                                    | `@spartan/helm/button`                      |
| `libs/stepper`                          | `stepper`                                   | `@spartan/helm/stepper`                     |
| `libs/core`                             | `core`                                      | `@invento/core`                             |

```bash
npx nx lint ui-loader          # ✗ Cannot find project 'ui-loader'
npx nx lint shared-ui-loader   # ✅
```

**The three bare exceptions don't take a scope prefix, for two different reasons.** `libs/ui/*` is
Spartan-generated code, addressed via `@spartan/helm/<name>` rather than the
`@invento/<scope>-<type>-<name>` convention — prefixing it `ui-` would collide with the 20
`libs/shared/ui-*` presentational libraries. `libs/core` and `libs/stepper` are each a single
standalone project, not a domain library sitting under a scope directory, so there is no `<dir>` to
prefix.

This is no longer a convention you have to remember correctly: `scripts/check-project-names.mjs`
derives the required name for every `project.json` from its path and fails the ones that don't
match. It runs in `.husky/pre-commit` and as the first step of CI (`npm run check:names`, then
`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) — a project name cannot drift from its path again without failing
the commit or the build.

**Don't guess — look it up.** [workspace-map.md](./workspace-map.md) lists all three columns for
every project, or ask Nx directly:

```bash
npx nx show projects                            # every project name
npx nx show project shared-ui-loader --json    # one project's root, tags, targets
```

### The alias convention

For everything except the Spartan primitives, the alias is **`@invento/<scope>-<type>-<name>`** and
matches the tags exactly:

```
scope:shared         + type:ui          + loader   →  @invento/shared-ui-loader
scope:owner-dashboard + type:data-access + order    →  @invento/owner-dashboard-data-access-order
scope:user-site      + type:feature     + checkout →  @invento/user-site-feature-checkout
```

Spartan UI primitives use `@spartan/helm/<name>`; their style data lives at `@spartan/styles`. Each
app can import its own files via `@invento/<app>/*` (e.g. `@invento/user-site/*` →
`apps/user-site/src/*`) — that exemption is scoped to that app's own directory and cannot leak to
another project.

There are **120 aliases** registered in `tsconfig.base.json` (78 `@invento/*`, 42 `@spartan/*`).
**A new library does not resolve until you add its alias there.** Deep relative paths into another
library (`../../other-lib/src/lib/thing`) are always wrong and will fail lint.

---

## What a library looks like on disk

```
libs/user-site/data-access-cart/
├── project.json          ← name, tags, lint target
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.lib.json
└── src/
    ├── index.ts          ← the ONLY public surface
    └── lib/
        ├── cart.service.ts
        └── cart.interface.ts
```

**One entry point per library.** Nothing outside a library may import a deep path into it. If you
need something that is not exported from `index.ts`, export it deliberately — do not reach around it.

Real examples of each shape:

```ts
// type:feature — export routes, not page components
// libs/owner-dashboard/feature-products/src/index.ts
export { productsRoutes } from './lib/products.routes';

// type:data-access — the service, the store, the types
// libs/user-site/data-access-cart/src/index.ts
export { CartService } from './lib/cart.service';
export type { CartItem, ShippingAddressInput, CreateOrderPayload } from './lib/cart.interface';

// type:ui — the component
// libs/shared/ui-loader/src/index.ts
export * from './lib/loader';

// type:util — pure functions
// libs/shared/util-error/src/index.ts
export { extractErrorMessage } from './lib/error.utils';
```

A feature exports **routes** so an app cannot bypass routing and mount a page component directly.
Four libraries take a deliberate exception: `owner-dashboard-feature-shell`,
`user-site-feature-storefront`, `user-site-feature-product` and `user-site-feature-chatbot`. Three of
them explain themselves in a comment at the top of their own `index.ts` — read it before copying the
pattern. `owner-dashboard-feature-shell` carries no such comment (it appears to have been lost when
the library was renamed from `ui-shell`), even though `user-site-feature-storefront` cites it as the
precedent it followed.

---

## How it fits together — a real trace

Adding a product to the cart on the storefront:

```
apps/user-site/src/app/app.routes.ts            type:app           (URL → feature)
  └─ @invento/user-site-feature-product         type:feature       (the page)
       ├─ @invento/user-site-data-access-cart   type:data-access   (CartService)
       ├─ @invento/shared-ui-loader             type:ui            (spinner)
       └─ @invento/shared-util-error            type:util          (error text)
```

Every hop goes down the vertical ladder and stays inside `user-site` + `shared`. Nothing in this
trace can see `owner-dashboard`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run start:all              # all three apps at once (4200 / 4300 / 4400)
npm start                      # site-builder only
npm run start:user-site        # user-site only
npm run start:owner-dashboard  # owner-dashboard only

npm run build:all              # nx run-many -t build   — the 3 apps (see note below)
npm run lint                   # nx run-many -t lint    — all 119 projects
npm run format                 # prettier --write .     (does NOT touch libs/ — see traps.md)

npx nx build user-site                         # one project
npx nx lint owner-dashboard-feature-products   # one project (mind the project name!)
npx nx graph                                   # interactive dependency graph in the browser
npx nx show projects --affected                # what your change actually touches
```

**Why `lint` covers 119 projects and `build` covers 3:** every project has a `lint` target, but only
the three applications have a `build` target. Libraries are consumed **from source** through
`tsconfig.base.json` path aliases — they are never packaged. (`nx.json` documents why: per-library
`ng-packagr` packaging is broken by design here, since the Spartan libraries share source across
library roots and trip TS6059.) So a library's code is compiled as part of whichever app imports it,
and `npx nx build <some-lib>` is not a thing.

`build`, `lint`, and `test` are cached. A repeat run should report cache hits; if results look stale
after editing `eslint.config.ts` or `tsconfig.base.json`, run `npx nx reset` first.

---

## Finding the library that owns something

Grepping `apps/` will mostly find nothing — the code is not there. In order of speed:

1. **[workspace-map.md](./workspace-map.md)** — the full path/name/alias/purpose table.
2. **`npx nx graph`** — click a project to see its dependents and dependencies.
3. **`npx nx show projects --affected`** after touching a file — tells you what depends on it.
4. `grep -rn "ClassName" libs/ --include=*.ts` — last resort, but scoped to `libs/`.
