# Traps and troubleshooting

Things in this workspace that behave differently from what you would reasonably expect. Each entry
leads with the **symptom you would actually see**, because that is how you will arrive here.

## 1. Nx project name is derived from its path

**This used to be a trap; it is now the rule that replaced one.** Before the naming-scheme cleanup,
`scope:shared` libraries dropped the scope prefix from their Nx project name while the other three
scopes kept it, so a large fraction of libraries had a name you could not derive from the path. That
inconsistency is gone: every project name is now mechanically derivable from its directory, and
`scripts/check-project-names.mjs` (run via `npm run check:names`, and wired into `.husky/pre-commit`
and CI) fails the check if it isn't.

| Directory                    | Nx project name         | Import alias                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `apps/<app>`                 | `<app>`                 | self-import, e.g. `@invento/user-site/*` |
| `libs/shared/<dir>`          | `shared-<dir>`          | `@invento/shared-<dir>`                  |
| `libs/owner-dashboard/<dir>` | `owner-dashboard-<dir>` | `@invento/owner-dashboard-<dir>`         |
| `libs/user-site/<dir>`       | `user-site-<dir>`       | `@invento/user-site-<dir>`               |
| `libs/site-builder/<dir>`    | `site-builder-<dir>`    | `@invento/site-builder-<dir>`            |
| `libs/ui/<primitive>`        | `<primitive>` (bare)    | `@spartan/helm/<primitive>`              |
| `libs/core`                  | `core` (bare)           | `@invento/core`                          |
| `libs/stepper`               | `stepper` (bare)        | `@spartan/helm/stepper`                  |

`libs/ui/*` and `libs/stepper` stay bare rather than taking a scope prefix — prefixing the 40 Spartan
primitives `ui-` would collide with the 20 `libs/shared/ui-*` presentational libraries, and they're
consumed through the separate `@spartan/helm/*` alias family anyway.

**Consequence:** the `@invento/*` alias tail now equals the project name exactly, with zero
mismatches across all 78 `@invento/*` aliases in `tsconfig.base.json`. `npx nx lint shared-ui-loader`
works; the old `npx nx lint ui-loader` no longer resolves.

**Fix, if you still hit `Cannot find project '<name>'`:** derive it from the table above, or look it
up in [workspace-map.md](./workspace-map.md), or `npx nx show projects`.

---

## 2. Lint is green and the build is broken

**Symptom:** `npx nx lint <lib>` passes; `npx nx build <app>` fails with
`Cannot find module '@invento/…'`.

**Why:** ESLint does not typecheck module resolution. A library whose alias is missing from
`tsconfig.base.json` lints perfectly and fails only when TypeScript tries to resolve it.

**Fix:** register the alias (the `paths` block is in insertion order, not alphabetical — append
rather than trying to slot it in):

```json
"@invento/<scope>-<type>-<name>": ["./libs/<scope>/<type>-<name>/src/index.ts"],
```

**Rule of thumb: always run both gates.** Lint alone proves nothing about whether the code compiles.

---

## 3. Boundary errors have three legitimate fixes

**Symptom:** `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` fails naming a source tag and a target tag.

**Why:** two constraint matrices apply at once (`eslint.config.ts:34-72`) — the `type:` ladder and
the `scope:` isolation rule. See
[architecture.md](./architecture.md#the-boundary-matrices).

**Fix**, in order of preference:

1. Move the code to `scope:shared` — if two scopes genuinely need it.
2. Retag the library — a "presentational" component that reads live session state is not `type:ui`.
   `owner-dashboard-feature-shell` and `user-site-feature-storefront` are tagged `type:feature` for
   exactly this reason.
3. Invert the dependency — pass data in as an input.

**Not a fix:** adding to the rule's `allow` list. It has been empty since the restructure and every
exemption that ever existed was fixed at the source instead of silenced.

---

## 4. Nx serves a cached lint result

**Symptom:** you edit `eslint.config.ts` or `tsconfig.base.json`, re-run lint, and get the previous
run's verdict.

**Fix:**

```bash
npx nx reset
npm run lint
```

Two follow-on gotchas:

- Immediately after `nx reset`, a boundary check can emit
  `No cached ProjectGraph is available. The rule will be skipped.` That is **not** a pass — the rule
  did not run. Run it again once the graph is built.
- `--skip-nx-cache` bypasses the cache for a single run without wiping it, which is usually what you
  want when verifying a fix.

---

## 5. `libs/` is Prettier-ignored

**Symptom:** `npm run format` reformats `apps/` and `docs/` but leaves `libs/` untouched.

**Why:** `.prettierignore` lists `libs` wholesale.

**Consequence:** code under `libs/` is **not** auto-formatted — match the surrounding style by hand.
Do not "helpfully" run Prettier over a library; it produces an enormous unrelated diff.

Separately, `libs/ui/**` and `libs/stepper/**` are exempt from the strict ESLint block
(`eslint.config.ts:101`) and get relaxed rules instead, because that code is generated by the Spartan
CLI. Selector prefixes, input renaming, and the `OnPush` requirement are all off there.

---

## 6. `OnPush` is mandatory

**Symptom:** `@angular-eslint/prefer-on-push-component-change-detection` error on a new component.

**Why:** the rule is `error` workspace-wide, and as of the restructure there are **zero** outstanding
violations in `apps/` or `libs/`. Keep it that way.

```ts
changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
```

The exemption is `libs/ui/**` and `libs/stepper/**` only.

---

## 7. Tailwind entry imports must stay in the app

**Symptom:** the app builds, but utility classes used in templates are missing from the output CSS.

**Why:** Tailwind v4 roots its automatic source detection at the file containing the entry import.
Move that import into a file under `libs/` and detection re-roots there, silently purging every class
used in app templates.

**Rule:** these lines stay in each app's own `src/styles.css`:

```css
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);
@import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base);
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css';
```

Shared **tokens** may live in a library and be imported after those lines. The entry imports may not.

---

## 8. owner-dashboard's theme CSS used to be a fork

**Fixed, kept here because the old symptom is worth knowing about:** a design token added to
`libs/core/src/styles/spartan-theme.css` used to reach site-builder and user-site but not
owner-dashboard, because owner-dashboard's `styles.css` was a fully inlined 358-line copy that never
imported the shared file. That is no longer true.

| App             | `src/styles.css`                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| site-builder    | 9 lines — Tailwind entry + `@import '…/libs/core/src/styles/spartan-theme.css'` at line 9  |
| user-site       | 19 lines — the same import at line 9, plus a `scrollbar-gutter` rule                       |
| owner-dashboard | 94 lines — the same import at line 12, plus a CDK-overlay import and its own keyframe tail |

owner-dashboard's one app-specific _import_ is:

```css
@import '@angular/cdk/overlay-prebuilt.css';
```

The shared theme file does not ship this stylesheet — worth knowing if CDK-overlay-positioned UI
(menus, dialogs) looks unstyled in site-builder or user-site; they never imported it either, because
they never needed the CDK overlay module.

**Consequence for you:** touching `libs/core/src/styles/spartan-theme.css` now reaches all three apps
in one edit. See [deep-dives/theming.md](./deep-dives/theming.md).

---

## 9. Two libraries are deliberately empty

`libs/shared/util-environment` and `libs/shared/util-template` both export nothing:

```ts
export {};
```

They exist as declared destinations from the restructure whose intended contents were deleted rather
than migrated. They have **zero consumers**. Don't be confused by importing one and getting nothing —
and if you have a genuine home for environment or template helpers, these are the right places.

---

## 10. The root `tsconfig.json` reference list is intentionally partial

**Not a live trap — nothing in this repo runs `tsc -b`.** The root `tsconfig.json` lists **34**
project references for a workspace of **119** projects. That was never meant to be a complete list:
Angular's builder resolves each project through its own `tsconfig.app.json`, so `npm run build:all`
and `npm run lint` never read the root file's reference graph at all.

The one thing this list used to get wrong — a reference to `libs/shared/ui-home-components`, a
library that had been deleted — has been fixed; the list is now 34 references and **0 dangling**.

**Consequence for you:** when adding a library, **do not** add a root `tsconfig.json` reference.
Nothing reads that list as an authority, and adding to a partial list makes it look maintained when
it is not.

---

## 11. A case-only rename does nothing on this machine

**Symptom:** you rename `Preview.ts` to `preview.ts` (case only), `git status` shows a clean working
tree, the change builds locally — and case-sensitive CI then fails to find the file, or an import
resolves to the wrong casing.

**Why:** this repo's `.git/config` has `core.ignorecase=true` (the Windows/NTFS default), and NTFS
itself is case-insensitive. A rename that only changes case looks like a no-op to the filesystem, so
Git's index keeps the **old** casing even though the file on disk — and in your editor — now reads
correctly. `git status` is not lying about the working tree; it is comparing against an index that
already silently "matches," so it is the wrong tool to trust here.

Real example from this workspace: `libs/core/src/lib/interface/Preview.ts` and
`libs/core/src/lib/utils/Preview-css-parser.ts` were renamed to `preview.ts` and
`preview-css-parser.ts`.

**Fix:** force the rename through Git explicitly:

```bash
git mv --force Preview.ts preview.ts
```

**Verification:** use `git ls-files`, **not** `git status` — `git status` is exactly the command this
trap hides from:

```bash
git ls-files | grep -i preview
```

If that still prints the old casing, the index has not moved and CI will still fail.

None of these block work. They are listed so you do not spend an afternoon rediscovering one.
